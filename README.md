# Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Plan


This project involved conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and penetration testing for a fictional tech company, following a significant data breach. Using tools such as Nmap, Nessus, WPScan, and Nikto, I identified critical vulnerabilities in the companyâ€™s web server and WordPress application, including OpenSSH Remote Code Execution (CVE-2023-38408) and Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2024-8522). After exploiting these vulnerabilities, I developed a detailed remediation plan that focused on patch management, secure configuration, and long-term security strategies. The project is divided into four phases: vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, secure configuration management, and final reporting.

The full report, methodology, and remediation strategies are included in the repository.
